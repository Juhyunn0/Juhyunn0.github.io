This project was completed as part of the CS480 course at the Illinois Institute of Technology.   
Sudoku is a combinatorial, logic-based, number-placement puzzle. In classic Sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 sub-grids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution
  
My task is to implement in Python the following constraint satisfaction problem algorithms:  
  
Brute force (exhaustive) search algorithm,  
Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) back-tracking search,  
CSP with forward-checking and MRV heuristics  
and apply them to solve the puzzle (provided in a CSV file).
