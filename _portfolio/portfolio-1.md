Our overall goal of this project is to relate information regarding income and education to TIF districts in Chicago. By further analysis, we aim to determine any inequalities that may have arisen alongside TIFs. We hope the results of this project can further inform Chicago citizens of possible inequalities present in the current tax system of the city. The background research conducted mainly focused on the inconsistencies in how TIF funds are handled. The TIF Illumination Project was a valuable resource to further understand how much is collected and spent by TIFs and the large difference between those amounts. For example, 2022 TIF revenue totaled $960 million while the expenses were only $362 million. Previous studies on TIFs were also researched to further understand how TIFs have already been analyzed. Most studies focused on jobs and property values, so we instead chose to consider other factors that could contribute to socioeconomic success. Overall, from these studies, it seemed that the positive effects of TIFs came at the expense of other taxing districts, like public schools. Based on our findings, there are substantial increases in the median income of TIF districts that are predominantly white, while other races are not affected significantly. This further substantiates the claims of critics that tax increment financing is racist and possibly stimulates gentrification.
