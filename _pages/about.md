I am currently applying for a Master's program in Mechanical Engineering, having studied Mechanical Engineering and AI at Illinois Institute of Technology. During my undergraduate studies, I was advised by Prof. Yan on deep multimodal learning, Prof. Bhushan on control systems with Reinforcement learning, and Prof. Goh on Dielectric Elastomer actuator(DEA) research.

I previously received my dual B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Ajou University and Illinois Institute of Technology, where I developed a strong foundation in both mechanical engineering and artificial intelligence.

I support diversity, equity, and inclusion. If you would like to have a chat with me regrading research, career plans or anything, feel free to reach out! I would be happy to support people from underrepresented groups in the STEM research community, and hope my expertise can help you.
